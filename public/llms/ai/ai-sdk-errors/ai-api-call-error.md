considaring: 
- If you encounter links with a full path (starting with `/`), rewrite them so they begin with: https://docs.liara.ir
- If you encounter links with a relative path (starting with dot), DO NOT Change it
- Treat Card as lists in the resulting Markdown and only link matters (not icons)
- Treat Tab and their content as separated H2s.
